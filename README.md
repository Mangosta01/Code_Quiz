# Week 6 Challenge : Code_Quiz

Code Quiz developed with Web APIs

Javascript code for Password Generator App

## Overview

The week 6 challenge required me to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The application will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

Features of the application are described below:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * 
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * 
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
